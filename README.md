# Gemini Weather Dashboard & Chatbot

Gemini Weather is a web-based application that provides current weather information through two interfaces:

1. **Dashboard**: Displays current weather conditions based on the city entered by the user.
2. **Chatbot**: A weather chatbot where users can ask about the weather in various locations and get an instant response.

This app uses the **OpenWeather API** to fetch real-time weather data and the **Google Generative AI API** to assist with chatbot queries.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather**: Get current weather data including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- **Weather Chatbot**: Ask about the weather in a conversational way, and get detailed weather information.
- **Simple, Minimalistic UI**: Easy to use, with a responsive and clean design.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (for a local HTTP server, though not strictly required)
- An IDE or a text editor (like VS Code or Sublime Text)
